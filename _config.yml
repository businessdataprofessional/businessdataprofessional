  This is a collection of data analytics projects both from my graduate work as well as those that stemmed from personal interest 
  <br><br>
  I have successfully earned my MS degree in Business Analytics with a specialization in Data Science. With a strong foundation in medical device engineering and project management, I am newly-equipped with a diverse skill set that enables me to tackle complex problems through Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive and Spatial Analytics. The dynamic realm of Data Analytics continuously evolves, and I am excited to channel my newfound expertise into this rapidly advancing field. By venturing into this domain, my goal is to deliver invaluable contributions to organizations by pairing my engineering acumen with data-driven analysis and decision-making processes.
